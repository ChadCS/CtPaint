# CtPaint

CtPaint is basically a clone of MSPaint in browser.

~~Its not near completion, and I have no releases of it yet.~~
CtPaint vB.0 is complete: www.ctpaint.us
I suggest using firefox, where pixelation is possible. Presently, image smoothing cannot be turned off in google chrome. I hear the css property 'image-rendering: pixelated' is coming out this November 2014 with Chrome 40. 

# Navigating this repo

ctpaint.coffee is the file run in the browser via ctpaint.html. gulpfile.js concatenates the many coffeescript files found in the various folders mainAct, postures, and initialization, into ctpaint.coffee

Initilization contains coffeescript files that mainly define functions and global variables. mainAct.coffee mostly handles user mouse and keyboard input. Postures contains tool-specific user input functions. The basic flow of the CtPaint is the mainAct registering an event, then refering to tool-specific functions (postures), which in turn give information to functions used by those tools.

Assets contain the images of the icons, toolbars, and glyphs

deletedScenes contains images of my notes during this project, as well as images of my MSPaint work environment while drawing the assets.

glyphGeneration contains a python file and some png files. The python file recolors the png files to make many of the assets I use.

spriteGeneration contains a python file and a png file. The python file crops sections out of the png file to make all the icons and toolbar images I use.

# Demos
